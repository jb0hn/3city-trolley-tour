# 3city-trolley-tour

Welcome in TriCity Trolley Tour!

In this extremely simple text-based game the player needs to drive
an imaginary trolley traveling from station to station along the SKM railway
line.

The journey begins on the Gdańsk Śródmieście station and the farthest train
station a player can arrive is Gdynia Główna.

To be honest, the game isn't very enjoyable and was created while I was learning OOP in Python to present my actual skill level.
