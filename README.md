# Welcome to TriCity Trolley Tour!

In this extremely simple text-based game the player needs to drive
an imaginary trolley traveling from station to station along the SKM railway
line.

The journey begins on the Gdańsk Śródmieście station and the farthest train
station a player can arrive is Gdynia Główna.

To be honest, the game isn't very enjoyable and was created while I was learning OOP in Python, to present my actual skill level.

To run on GNU/Linux, open the Terminal and paste:

    cd /path/to/the/game/folder

    python3 3city-travel.py


To run on Windows, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and paste:

    cd /path/to/the/game/folder

    python 3city-travel.py


The game was tested on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 16.04.2 with Python 3.5.2) and Windows (Windows 10 with Python 3.6.4).
